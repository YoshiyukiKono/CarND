## Project: Lane Line Detection (Self-Driving Car ND)

- **Overview**: This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect lane lines from a video feed captured from a front-facing camera mounted on a vehicle.
- **Tech stack**: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Python
- **What I did**:
  - Applied grayscale, Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection
  - Used Hough transform to detect and overlay lines
  - Handled noisy frames and averaged lane detection
- **What I learned**:
  - Basic image processing pipeline
  - Edge-based feature detection
  - Importance of real-time optimization
